BNdownscale
==========

**BNdownscale** aims to apply Discrete Bayesian Networks to climate statistical downscaling. The main functions, build.downscalingBN() and downscale.BN(), respectivelly build and predict with the model. They are specifically prepared to work with the climate data set structures provided by the [`loadeR` bundle](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR) for data access.
